RADIS app is a web application for Radis high-resolution infrared molecular spectra. Instead of writing code, this project aims to create an intuitive user interface (UI).

It use radis internally to produce spectrum, and the updated version and radis algorithm make it incredibly efficient to compute the millions of lines in only a few minutes.

Radis app leverages React 18 to offer the user interface, and FastApi on the backend. We are using react-hook-form for the fastest user experience and to maintain performance on the client slide. In the backend, we use FastApi to offer the fastest response.
